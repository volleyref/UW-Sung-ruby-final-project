This is a Ruby final project

git@github.com:volleyref/UW-Sung-ruby-final-project.git


The people search script calls the whitepages pro api.

Base url api:  https://proapi.whitepages.com/find_person/1.0/?api_key=8249b41718b02c013694000c6900061e;outputtype=JSON

We then append the search parameters that we query from the user:  ;firstname=#{fname};lastname=#{lname};where=#{where}"

The only required field is Lastname.  If the firstname or the where location is left blank, the search will be a broader search with no firstname or nationwide.

The long term goal is to have all this driven by a webpage UI but for now, it's all invoked from command line.

ruby  ./people_search.rb 


The resulting JSON is parsed and the following information is presented to the user (again, the long term goal is to present the results as a webpage)
